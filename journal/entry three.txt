this is enty three in the devlog of ROOMS

the end goal is an adventure game, similar to the Legend of Zelda series' 2d entries.

what was done this session:

issues with .quad file loading have been resolved

place holders have been inserted to represent the major HUD elements in the game state

all functions have been rewritten to take advantage of the new resource manager if necessary.
the resource manager provides marked improvement in framerate though still more optimisations may need to be made.
in light of the pretty concrete terrain hights, different tiles may be made for each one, which would require the room draw
function to do less work. the only downside is more memory would be needed for the textures, but the savings in time will probably outweigh this

now that I think about, that's all I did this session. it was pretty time consuming. in the end, it turned out I had misspelt something in the
.quad file loader. that's how it goes!

anyways

that's about the long and short of it.

if you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment or email me at
