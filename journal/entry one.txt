hello world.

today I began serious work on our new game:
ROOMS

the end goal is an adventure game, similar to the Legend of Zelda series' 2d entries.

the game will be made with love.
that is, LÃ¶ve, a 2d game engine.

all things are currently being done by myself, with the possibility of help later on.

who am I?
I don't use conventional caps, I listen to diverse musics, I eat all the pizza.
I am player one

enough introduction.

what was done this session:

a main start screen and load menu have been partially coded.

there are no graphics yet, so the title and buttons are all place holders right now.

I added a little effect to the words on the start screen to make them more interesting.

this idea may end up persisting throughout the game's visual design.

underlying these two menus are:

a state system,

a tween system,

a gui system,

and a font system.

that is most of the progress for this session.

that's about the long and short of it.

if you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment or email me at

be careful out there.
