this is enty two in the devlog of ROOMS

the end goal is an adventure game, similar to the Legend of Zelda series' 2d entries.

what was done this session:

the load menu is now forgone for the more practical game state,

systems are now in place to automagically recognise new assets and index them,

quads for sprite sheets and tilesets can be loaded from a ".quad" file,

the menus now have filler art,

initial camera support is in place,

and a fps cap of 48 fps has been imposed on the game, in addition
to a funcition which disables canvas blanking.

that's about the long and short of it.

if you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment or email me at

unonuorea@gmail.com

be careful out there.
